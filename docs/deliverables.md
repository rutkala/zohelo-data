# Zohelo-data delivery plan

Approved work programme, 6 September 2026. The owner approved this scope; that approval did not settle the business or architecture choices recorded below. The initial user is the owner. The NBP scope is all already-ingested history for Tables A, B, C and gold prices.

## Current status

Updated 7 September 2026. **The audit implementation is in final validation; it is not yet the verified live release.** The existing 15-table NBP release and portal remain available. No owner methodology question is blocking the technical work.

This is the single project-status and owner-question record. Research, architecture, runbooks and dated release evidence support it; they are not additional task boards. The portal remains a data tool.

**Status meanings:** **Done** = delivered and evidenced; **In progress** = active work or verification; **On hold** = explicitly excluded for now with a reason and reopening condition; **Waiting for input** = an owner choice; **Not started** = future implementation; **Cancelled** = intentionally retired.

| Deliverable | Status | What this means |
| --- | --- | --- |
| D1. Repository, architecture and all Actions audit | **In progress** | Audits complete; publication safeguards, recovery, workflow hardening, obsolete-path cleanup and capacity reporting are under integrated validation. [Audit](audits/2026-09-07-readiness.md), [all workflow decisions](audits/2026-09-07-workflows.md). |
| D2. Reproducible environment and shared instructions | **Done** | Pinned Python/Node dependencies, fresh-container checks and standard human/agent instructions exist. Audit updates preserve the supported npm/Python path. |
| D3. Source contracts, correction evidence and gold design | **In progress** | Source definitions researched; missing/reappeared currency candidates, typed-record hashes and explicit ingestion policy are implemented and being verified. No source values are rescaled or deleted. |
| D4. NBP end-to-end including semantic queries | **In progress** | Five source-defined daily MetricFlow metrics and a read-only local restore/query interface are implemented. Live metric/publication/replay evidence still needs the reviewed run. |
| D5. One data catalogue with source and metric lineage | **In progress** | Existing native dbt viewer stays; release metadata now includes methodology/frequency/reuse evidence and real semantic definitions. Matching publication is pending. |
| D6. Define and onboard additional sources | **Waiting for input** | Candidate research exists. Selection is the next topic after this audit's verification; no new source is being ingested. Onboarding is **Not started**. |
| D7. Portal UX and shared desktop/mobile theme | **In progress** | Prior portal delivery is done. Only a narrow Run-button palette alignment, identity/toolchain cleanup and regression checks are in this audit. |
| Working agreement for the Zohelo-data subproject | **In progress** | [Collaboration instructions](collaboration.md) define focused chats, GitHub status, Drive artifacts and human-operable handoffs; included in the pending reviewed change. |
| Completed one-time migration workflow / old executable builders | **Cancelled** | Migration evidence and read-only comparison script remain; obsolete workflow and direct mutating CLI paths are retired. |

## Explicit holds and reopening conditions

These are visible limits, not claims of completed functionality. None requires inventing an owner methodology answer to finish the five daily source metrics.

| ID | Held work | Why / when to reopen |
| --- | --- | --- |
| H-CAP | Reference-safe state compaction and automatic archive/release deletion | Current policy retains all evidence. Capacity reporting warns at 70% of any build/state bound. Design/test compaction before that threshold or before onboarding a source that would cross it; never raise caps or delete old files blindly. |
| H-SERVE | Always-on/multi-user semantic API | On-demand native MetricFlow and CSV are the present supported experience. Reopen for a named BI integration, availability need or shared-service use case with hosting/authentication requirements. |
| H-DERIVED | Spread, period average, return, conversion and other derived metrics | Optional business calculations need an intended use and explicit aggregation/missing-date rules. Source-defined daily values proceed without them. |
| H-FX | Exhaustive historic currency identity/unit validation | Sampled official comparisons support API normalization; values remain unchanged. Validate the specific currency/history before governed conversion/accounting use. No PLN redenomination transform applies to the post-2002 API. |
| H-REUSE | Commercial redistribution of NBP data | Official material establishes public read access but did not establish the complete commercial redistribution/attribution grant. Resolve terms for the intended sharing product before releasing that feature. |
| H-HOST | Commercial hosted service on GitHub Pages | Pages has commercial-hosting restrictions. Select suitable hosting before turning the owner project portal into a commercial data/SaaS service. |
| H-GIT | Server-side branch protection/rulesets | The branch API reports `main` unprotected; the connector cannot administer this setting. Maintain reviewed PR/check discipline and configure enforcement before adding collaborators or depending on automatic protection. |
| H-REV | Whole-publication disappearance and transformation-only row-delta ledger | Comparable currency omissions are detected; absent publications are ambiguous. Immutable raw/releases and code/contract versions remain evidence. Reopen for a real anomaly or a model migration requiring explicit cross-release deltas. |
| H-SCALE | Broad portal feature pruning, module/package restructuring or orchestration/storage migration | The owner asked to keep the portal stable. Reopen against measured performance/maintenance needs or a selected source benchmark; no speculative framework replacement. |

## Owner decisions

**Q-M1 is resolved for the baseline:** the 7 September instruction authorizes researching and implementing source-defined daily NBP observations. Five definitions are documented in [NBP methodology](nbp-business-definitions.md). It is no longer a blocker. Optional derived metrics are H-DERIVED.

| ID | Next decision | Preparation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Q-S1 | Which source/topic should be evaluated next, and what decision or analysis should it support? | [Eurostat and World Bank WDI research](source-candidates.md), plus any other source the owner proposes. Ask after the current verification is complete. |

## Evidence

Previous verified release: `84784104-e014-4550-bb0c-095d967230b5`, producer [`71f79fc`](https://github.com/rutkala/zohelo-data/commit/71f79fc4fbaa7f8c1f2b2133b4f62106f13fcf02). It contains 15 tables and 429,795 cleaned observations, with fresh SQL and exact raw replay. [Prior portal/data evidence](releases/2026-09-07-medallion-portal.md).

The current audit's final CI, deployment, actual metric-query, replay and capacity results will be recorded in one dated release evidence document before these active rows become Done. Local passing fixtures alone do not establish a live delivery.

[Current architecture](architecture.md) explains tool choices and commercial/service boundaries. [Operations](nbp-platform-operations.md) gives the Actions and command-line path without AI. [Working agreement](collaboration.md) explains how to start a focused new chat and resume from this record.

## Approved scope by deliverable

### D1. Platform, repository and GitHub Actions audit

Audit business goals, architecture, code quality, security, workflows, effective Drive boundaries, and cost feasibility. Keep a workflow and requirements map, repair OAuth/workflow/stage-handoff/publication failures, and base claims on evidence.

### D2. Reproducible development environment and AI instructions

Provide a fresh Codespaces path for bounded local data and portal checks with explicit Python and Node versions, locked dependencies, shared agent instructions, and visible side effects. Opening the environment must not run production pipelines or an unrestricted agent.

### D3. Data contracts, ingestion rules and gold dimensional design

For A/B/C FX rates and gold prices, document row grain, keys, units, date roles, corrections, deduplication, source batches, watermarks, overlaps, retries, schema handling, catch-up, and rebuild from retained raw. Use current validated values for normal analysis while retaining raw versions and detected changes; a historical-comparison UI is outside scope. The gold design must state fact/dimension grain and business aggregation rules rather than invent them.

### D4. Complete NBP end-to-end

Make all four NBP datasets, existing history, and agreed catch-up range available through bronze, silver, modeled gold, semantic definitions, and the portal. Record inputs for replay, identify unavailable legacy raw inputs, keep SQL and any semantic service on the matching release, restore a release in a fresh process, and preserve the prior complete release if publication fails.

### D5. Business data catalogue

The catalogue covers the connected release: sources and datasets (description, licence/reuse terms, coverage, frequency, status, and identity); release-specific lineage from source through gold and any approved semantic models; and approved metrics with definition, formula, unit, dimensions, time aggregation, approval state, and version. It distinguishes last attempt, last successful ingestion, latest observation, and latest validated publication. It must let the owner discover data and trace an approved metric to physical data and validated publication without GitHub or code. It must not contain project-management or owner-review content.

### D6. Source expansion research and onboarding

Maintain a business-led, prioritized onboarding path. A source must be public, free to obtain, and permitted for the intended commercial use; record attribution, redistribution, and dataset-specific conditions. For a chosen source, add contracts, fixtures, extraction, lineage, recovery, release controls, and testing without weakening the NBP platform boundary.

### D7. Data-first portal and SQL experience

Deliver a focused data-first portal update: one native dbt catalogue for published data, lineage, and metric definitions; no project-management or owner-review UI; and SQL that automatically loads every released table referenced by a statement, including joins, unions, and CTEs. Keep published data-file downloads within 64 MiB per engine session and explain a limit failure before execution. Catalogue artifacts have a separate 16 MiB limit; these download limits are not guarantees about query memory use. A modern palette and layout may support this bounded experience. Portal validation, CI, and deployment are required before any of this new behavior is described as live.

## Cross-cutting acceptance requirements

Across D1–D5: verify business examples and representative fixtures; use the same inputs, cutoff, and revision policy for full/incremental equivalence; prove safe versioned publication and raw rebuild; expose release, provenance, status, errors, and source batches clearly; and measure operating limits without assuming a date, cost, SLA, or unlimited free capacity.
